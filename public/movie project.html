        <h3>Grind</h3>
            <p>This one is purely nostalgia for me. I love what it represents to me.</p>

        <h3>Seven</h3>
            <p>Great crime/thriller movie.</p>

        <h3>Den of Theives</h3>
            <p>A good heist movie always grabs my attention.<br />
                This one is probably the best one in recent years.</p>
